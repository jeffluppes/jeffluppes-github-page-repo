I just got [Hexo](http://hexo.io/) up and running and it seems to work smoothly. I was pretty excited to find a blog based on node.js and coming from a world of Wordpress it was amusing that people actually ported Wordpress themes to Hexo. Normally I would have preferred a much more minimalistic skin, but as I hope to post about outdoors stuff too, I figured I could use some color in my theme.

## Why the hell did you choose Hexo though?
I'll admit it. I'm not someone who usually adopts software if there isn't a great community supporting it. As [Hexo](http://hexo.io/)'s community is mostly Chinese it could be hard to get English-language help, but configuring Hexo was easy and just a little bit of command line stuff. Editing is easy, too. And I couldn't really find a reason not to go for a static blog.
## Does the world really need another student building yet another blog?
Some say blogs are a bit for the self-centered. But I think it's  fairly human to ramble on about ourselves. We need it. It's how products like Myspace (..) and Facebook got huge. I hope to update this every once in while with cool stuff, uni projects, perhaps some trip info and pics of the latter. Perhaps someday this site attracts enough traffic to die. I will shed a single tear that day.
## Why don't you post in Dutch though?
I guess I will eventually, it'd be [gezellig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gezelligheid).

## And what about your old Wordpress site?
Eh, saying goodbye to a site doesn't need a ceremony now does it?
